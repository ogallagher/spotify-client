# Spotify client

Fetch signature/personal listening info for an authenticated spotify user. This app lacks several features to be more generally usable:

- [ ] setup and usage documentation
- [ ] cli command options
- [ ] commit to external spotify sdk methods when possible (ex. instead of custom authentication handling)
- [ ] unit tests
